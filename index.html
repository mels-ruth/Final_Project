        <h1>Hotspots & Weather: Mapping and Predicting High-Risk Accident Windows in the US</h1>
        
        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction to Topic</h2>
            <p>Road traffic crashes are a major public-health and infrastructure problem. Identifying geographic "hotspots" helps transportation planners prioritize countermeasures (signage, engineering, enforcement), while understanding how weather and environmental conditions change risk enables targeted warnings or adaptive traffic control. 
                Using a large, multi-year, national dataset, we will detect statistically significant spatial accident hotspots across the contiguous U.S. and build weather-aware models to identify high-risk time windows. This combined approach can help direct resources to dangerous places and times, 
                and potentially show how weather factors interact with location and time to elevate accident risk.</p>

            <h2>About the Data</h2>
            <p>Our dataset comes from Kaggle and can be found here: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents/data">US Accidents (2016 - 2023)</a>. This dataset was collected via multiple traffic camera APIs covering streams from US and state DOTs, law enforcement feeds, and sensors for the continental United States from Feb 2016 to Mar 2023, with about 7.7M accident records. 
                Typical fields include: location (latitude, longitude), start/end timestamps, accident severity, weather variables (temperature, visibility, precipitation), road type, number of vehicles, and first-account descriptions.</p>

                    <strong>Summary of Findings:</strong>
                    <p>This plot groups Massachussets crash data into geographic grid cells, then counts how many accidents happened in each cell. The quantile-based bin system is better for displaying non-uniform distribution. Each circle is a bin, where the size of the bin is dependent on how many accidents occur in that location, 
                        and the color of the bin is dependent on the average severity of those crashes. The dataset is filtered to that each circle has at minimum 2 accidents.
                        This plot has tooltips for Most Common Road in the bin, Average severity (1 being least and 4 being most severe), and total number of accidents in the bin. The tooltips also show the most common road that the accident occurred on, giving a good sense of which roads tend to be the most dangerous or most likely for an accident to occur on.
                        From this plot, we can see that more severe accidents tend to happen on main highways like I-495, I-95, I-93, I-90, and I-91, probably due to the higher speed that vehicles are traveling at. The less-severe accidents are happening on less-popular roads, likely due to the decreased speed limits on those roads.</p>

            <div class="summary">
                <strong>Summary of Findings:</strong>
                <p>This is a side-by-side plot of Accident Counts and Average Severity in Massachusetts counties, with an interactive slider bar showing the values corresponding to each hour of the day. This is data from 2016-2023. 
                    From this plot, we can see that most accidents occur in Middlesex, Norfolk, and Suffolk counties during 8-7am and 4-5pm. This could be due to the rush-hour commute of people from suburbs into the city of Boston, who get into accidents on their way to and from work. 
                    From the corresponding severity map on the right, we can see that severity is highest in the middle of the night (12am - 4am, decreases during the day, then increases again around 8pm-11pm. 
                    This could be due to the fact that there are more drunk drivers are the road during this time, driving home from after-dinner drinks or clubs as the evening gets later. 
                    It seems that severity is higher in more rural regions, possibly due to the fact that it's harder to get ubers or rides from other people, and the only option late at night is to drive yourself under the influence.
                    It seems that there is an inverse relationship between accident count and accident severity, where more severe accidents are more rare and if lots of accidents are happening, they are not as severe. 
                    Future directions include plotting the relationship between accident count and accident severity.</p>

                <strong>Summary of Findings:</strong>
                <p>This is a line plot of the total number of incidents at a given hour overlaid on top of a bar chart showing the average severity during that hour. There is a drop where you may choose to filter the data from All, Individual Day, Weekend, or Weekday. 
                    This is data from 2016-2023 and there are some extra statistics at the bottom. We can see from the All graph that it's much safer to drive around peak work hours of 12pm - 3pm. It's least safe to drive in the dead of night from the hours of 1am - 5 am or after work around 8pm. 
                    All this is likely due to the natural number of drivers being lower during work and more in rush hour, as well as the fact that people drive more recklessly at late hours where the average person sleeps. 
                    Evident by the fact that the number of crashes at night are much lower but the severity is higher at peaks of 2.5. It's also good to note that weekends are generally less safe to drive in as well. This is shown by how the weekend chart becomes far more sporadic, with higher highs and lower lows. 
                    That makes perfect sense, since most people aren't working on weekends and are out later, having more fun. (usually involving alcohol)</p>

                <p>This is a basic bar chart meant to simply convey car crash severity to the weather condition that corresponds to it. It shows snow/ice, rain, fair, and fog weather conditions. They are also listed from highest to lowest severity in that order with snow/ice being an outlier and much higher than the others. 
                    The data shows that driving in snow/ice averages about 10% more severe crashes than rain weather and 12% more severe crashes for fair weather. It depicts that rain averages around only a 2% increase in crash severity from fair weather. 
                    It also shows fog/haze being practically the same when it comes to crash severity as fair weather. Overall, this graph shows that weather conditions clearly affect crash severity. Snow and ice lead to the most severe crashes, so drivers should use extra caution in those conditions.</p>

                <p>This heatmap displays the proportion of each accident severity level (1-4) in different weather conditions. The weather categories are sorted based on the highest proportion of severity 4.
                    The heatmap shows a clear pattern across nearly all weather categories: accidents are heavily concentrated in Severity 2, usually accounting for about 75 to 87% of incidents whether the weather is clear, cloudy, snowy, or more hazardous like hail, sleet, or dust storms. 
                    Severity 1 crashes remain rare, generally below 1%, with tornado conditions being a small exception at around 2.4%, although tornado data comes from far fewer total cases (you can hover over each box to see the total counts). 
                    Severity 3 accidents typically fall between 10 and 25% and are especially elevated in sleet and ice, rain and thunderstorms, and snow, suggesting that slippery roads or reduced visibility push more crashes into this moderate injury range.
                    Severity 4 accidents stay low across all weather types, usually within the 2 to 5% range, but sleet andice stands out with the highest share at 5.3 percent. Snow, hail, and dust or smoke also show slightly higher proportions of these most severe crashes, 
                    reinforcing that low traction and low visibility environments carry a greater risk of extreme outcomes. More common conditions like cloudy, clear, and the “other” category have some of the lowest Severity 4 proportions at around 2 to 3%, which suggests that typical or mildly adverse weather is less likely to produce the most serious crashes. 
                    Overall, the heatmap shows that while weather influences the distribution of crash severity to some extent, most accidents fall into the moderate Severity 2 category, and the weather types that appear most dangerous are often the common threats, such as ice and snow.

        <section class="introduction">
            <h2>Complete Summary</h2>
            <p>From our plots, we were able to observe some pretty clear trends in accident count, or the number of accidents that occur. From the first and second plots, we can see that accident count is highest on main highways, during rush-hour (7-9am and 5-7pm), and on weekdays. 
                This could imply that since the number of vehicles on the road is increased, the number of crashes or likelihood of a crash occurring is also increased. Interestingly, these rush-hour crashes do not appear to be very severe, as we can see from the second and third plots. 
                This could be due to higher amounts of traffic, causing the vehicles to move at a slower speed (since speed of vehicle is very strongly correlated with crash severity). 
            </p>
            <p>
                We also observed several different variables that appear to be associated with the severity of a car accident, namely, road type, day of the week, hour of the day, and weather at the time of the accident. 
                With respect to road type, accidents on highways tend to be more severe than on other types of roads, potentially due to higher speed limits on these roads and a higher volume of travel. Less severe accidents tend to be on less-populated roads, likely due to their lower speed limits. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In terms of a driver's safety when it comes to day of the week and the time we had some conclusive results from the data. It turns out that weekdays came out to having more car crashes than weekends generally, but weekends had more severe crashes. While the severity from an average weekday to weekend goes from 2.384 to 2.460, 
                only a 3.19% increase, the amount it can vary around certain times is greater. For example, around 1 am, severity from weekday to weekend increases 10.16%.  The data also gives us many insights into the less safe hours of the day to drive. We concluded that around 11 am and around 8 pm are when most accidents occur. 
                This can change drastically with the day of the week, reflecting work and socializing habits. Saturday has the majority of its crashes at 3 pm, possibly because there is no work or school to keep people off the road at this time.  Furthermore, it should be noted that there are fewer accidents during sleeping hours, 
                but the severity of those crashes are generally worse than at other times of the day. All this to say, drivers should stay vigilant at all times, as both the likelihood and severity of crashes can shift depending on the day and hour.
            </p>
            <p>
                The severity of the car accident also depends on the type of weather. Accidents of severity level 4 are rare, but they make up a higher proportion of accidents that occur in sleet, ice, snow, rain, and dust, indicating that visibility and road traction are two important factors that contribute to driving safety. 
                Overall, the goal of this analysis is to raise awareness of the conditions that tend to coincide with increased crash frequency and severity to help drivers make safer, more informed decisions on the road.
